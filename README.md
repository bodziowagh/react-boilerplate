# React + Typescript + Jest boilerplate 🍱

A plug & play package to avoid time consuming manual setup every time I start a new project.


`Package includes:`
- Typescript loader for webpack configuration
- Unit tests configuration
- React dependencies and basic setup
- Linter (tslint) setup
- Webpack dev server config for development
- Styles loader (sass)
- i18n (react-intl)

TODO:
- Redux + react-intl-redux
- Move @types to dev-dependencies?


Everythuing that has an `example` in its name serves just as an `example`. Remove it from your code.
