# React + Typescript + Jest boilerplate üç±

A plug & play package to avoid time consuming manual setup every time I start a new project.


`Package includes:`
- Typescript loader for webpack configuration
- Unit tests configuration (jest + enzyme)
- React dependencies and basic setup
- Linter (tslint) setup
- Webpack dev server config for development
- Styles loader (sass)
- i18n (react-intl + react-intl-redux)
- Redux state manager


Everything that has an `example` in its name serves just as an `example`. Remove it from your code.


TODO:
- Verify whether `ts-loader` and `@babel/typescript` do this same thing or not
