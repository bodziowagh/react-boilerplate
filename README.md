# React + Typescript + Jest boilerplate üç±

A plug & play package to avoid time consuming manual setup every time I start a new project. 
Disclaimer: I know of official boilerplates, this project's main goal was to actually set everything up manually by myself in order to be more aware of how things work. Also currently I like this specific setup.


`Package includes:`
- Typescript loader for webpack configuration
- Unit tests configuration (jest + enzyme)
- React dependencies and basic setup
- Linter (tslint) setup
- Webpack dev server config for development
- Styles loader (sass)
- i18n (react-intl + react-intl-redux)
- Redux state manager


Everything that has an `example` in its name serves just as an `example` (duh!). Remove it from your code.
